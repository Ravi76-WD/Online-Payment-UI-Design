# Online-Payment-UI-Design

In this simple project we have created a payment page
for transcation purpose.This simple project is created 
using HTML and CSS.

# Creating structure for web page-I have created structure of this 
payment page using Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML),later on 
we will be using Casceding Style Sheet(CSS) for styling the 
page.

# HTML Code:
In this HTML file we have mainly divided our webpage into several <div> tags, 
and we have use several classes as well like “main-content”, “center-content”, “last-content” etc.
These CSS classes are to stylize our HTML elements.

# Designing Our Payment Page:
Using CSS, we can store all the style information that our page would share.
Whenever a user will visit the web page, the browser will load all the related information 
along with the proper styling related to the contents of the page. 
In CSS, a class is an element group that is the same or similar.
You can have the elements that you want in a class. And each element can be a member of multiple classes. 
Every class has CSS attributes (like color and font-size) that are specific to that class.

# CSS Code: 
CSS allows us to create unique and interactive websites.
